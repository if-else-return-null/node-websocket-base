# node-websocket-base

WebSocket server template for nodejs and electron apps

***THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS***

This repository is meant to be a starting point for implementing a websocket server
in your own apps. It is designed to be used either as a child process of your app or as standalone server in a terminal.

You can either fork this repository or  copy the files you want into a new repository then edit as needed.
